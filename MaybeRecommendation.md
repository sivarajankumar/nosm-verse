BUILD TIME<br />
Scratch 4 Second Life (S4SL) being the classroom UI for quick scripting, Archipelis Designer for quick object making, all get dragged-n-dropped directly onto/into big blue nossum object bin, web dudes then assign objects and assets to OL nodes in ariadne<br />


RUN TIME <br />
Restrained Life client and openSim (or SL) server, Ariadne being the handshake-maker between a whole slew of out-of-world xml services (including OL) and the RL relay prim (who listens for & sends commands to each user's client, which is now running in RL mode, and therefore has an <a href='http://code.google.com/p/nosm-verse/wiki/RestrainedLifeAPI'>API</a> that locks/animates/forces movement)  in other words, ALL THE STUFF we've always needed for role-play but thought the 2nd life space didn't allow... turns out that's written into the client... and of course, the 1st market to have this as their central concern, the online fetish industry, went and forked the client (a while ago) so that you can send it restrictions, etc., and suddenly, their bdsm rituals were much more interesting! but as always, that code has since been given away, and has become it's own beast... more precisely, many beastly cousins, <a href='http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/LSL_Protocol/Restrained_Life_Relay/Other_Implementations/Maike_Short%27s_Relay'>one of which</a> works for us.
