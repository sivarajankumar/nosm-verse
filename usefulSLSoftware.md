> <br />Useful Software
> <br />Archipelis Designer:
> <br />Pros: very simple
> <br />Cons: very simple
> <br />Can be used on touch-table
> <br />Simple drawing makes things go
> <br />Rotate a drawing to give it weight/volume/etc...
> <br />To make it SL-optimal:
> <br />not use any operators like intersection or difference (only union is possible).
> <br />not use the mirror feature (please draw the mirrored part yourself).
> <br />use simple definitions of every contour (like a banana, for instance). Obviously, you can create a complex model, but this model should be based on a set of simple shapes.
> <br />Draw a molecule, upload it, everyone now sees it…. Cool! now to add to behaviour...
> <br /><br />Scratch for Second Life
> <br />More of a script generation tool… based on MIT's Scratch (made for the $100 laptop), S4SL generates LSL from visual blocks that you drag onto a canvas, and then paste the code into a prim's script…
> <br />Very useful for our needs… gives facilitators and even students an easy way to create basic objects to then be added and used in Ariadne
> <br /><br />OpenSim
> <br />A competitor to Linden Labs, openSim can also be used for local development and island-mode use. Ostensibly, if you are running MSSQL, IIS and openSim locally, you can have a full front to end demo of VERSE without access to SL or even the internet!

> <br />Eclipse plug-in: type-assist, in-line help
> <br />SLAT/BVH Hacker: To tweak and prepare BVH animations for SL upload. Remove frames, shorten anims (make duration for an uploaded anim is 30 seconds! Will need to break them up into mutliple anims and sequence them in Ariadne)
