# A challenge (and a plea) #
<br />
tho i started with coreldraw3, i STILL can't design a logo to save my life (see [above](http://nosm-verse.googlecode.com/hg/VERSE/src/ariadne/server/ariadne.jpg), to the left of the title). anyway, we're building a run-time gaming engine for Second Life, which is powered by a program called openLabyrinth.... so, of course, i went ahead and called this extension to OL 'Ariadne'... maybe if you read the story of that myth it'll make sense... ;)
<br /><br />
so now we need a logo.
<br /><br />
Ariadne : well, again, picking the most obvious, i was picturing a head shot of a woman, fairly abstracted, blocky-logo-ish, but still curvy and flowing, holding a ball of yarn, as seen from behind, over her left shoulder, and the way she's holding it, with the thread flying horizontally off the ball, & the flow of her hair, all this forms the bar and right wall of a capitalized 'A'.... or something like that!
<br /><br />
if the end of the thread could be coming at us in 3d (to emphasize the immersive aspect of this project), that would probably rock my world.
<br /><br />
sooooo..... any takers?

ps. it'll be in SL, on nossum island, on this site, and prob on nosm's stuff too (if it's sleek!)<br />
p.s. we are the newest med school on the outer tip of the oldest of ancient craters. isn't that neat?
